* Define kernel size to use for convolutions
  * 3x3 (look at immediate neighbors)
  * 7x7 (look at full environment; might not make sense -> board is 7x6)
  * a combination of the two
* Use encoder to spefcify value of moves based on chain completion
 * Use 0 or -1 for chain that are not completable
* Show that distribution clipping is always safe

* test if there is enough exploration in training
